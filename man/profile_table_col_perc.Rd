\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame of input variables}

\item{factor_vars}{variables that are to be treated as factors in the table output.
Will produce counts for each value for each variable. If weight_var is provided, will
produce weighted counts.}

\item{numeric_vars}{variables that are to be treated as numeric in the table output.
Will produce means for each variable. if weight_var is provided, will produce weighted means.}

\item{weight_var}{if not NULL, a vector that contains weights for each observation. The NULL
case is equivalent to all cases being weighted 1.}

\item{banner_var}{name of the variable to appear along the top of the table.}
